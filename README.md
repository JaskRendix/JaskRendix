*“Operating at the intersection of computational patterns and physical systems.”*

📍 **Ticino, Switzerland** | 🌍 **Remote / Mobile**

I build digital structures where logic and entropy fight for territory. Sometimes it's a monster-fighting RPG; other times it's a script that attempts to map the political stability of 14th-century Venice using SQL.

### 🔭 Current Focus
* **Architectural Stability:** Refactoring complex state logic until the code feels less like a house of cards and more like a Roman aqueduct.
* **Cross-Language Translation:** Stabilizing system architectures where different languages must talk to each other without losing their sanity.

### 🌱 The Workbench (Learning)
* **Procedural Generation:** Teaching machines to hallucinate landscapes, dungeons and infinite what-ifs.
* **Hardware Interfacing:** Forcing software to take a physical form, mostly because I like it when things click and whir.
* **Modern CI/CD:** Automated rigor. Because Barisan of Ibelin said "hold the line" and a good pipeline makes sure the line actually holds.

### 💬 Consult the Oracle On:
* **Systems Thinking:** Finding the hidden loops that govern both codebases and empires.
* **Full-stack Automation:** Building the machinery that does the boring stuff while we dream.
* **Chaotic Datasets:** Finding the signal when the noise starts whispering in Latin, Nahuatl or binary.

### 📫 Dispatch
* **Email:** menzigi@duck.com  
* **Status:** I've likely slipped into a historical rabbit hole or I'm busy debugging a simulation of a steampunk cathedral.
